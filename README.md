# node-based-modeling-opengl
node-based modeling tool developed for personal CG studies and experiments.  
The node UI was developed based on ImGuizmo.

![Demo GIF](asset/Chain_demo.gif)
This project is a work in progress, and features are still under development.  
However, this project is part of another private project, so updates are irregular.

⚠️ Note
- It has not been confirmed whether this project can run in environments below C++17. The development environment uses C++20.
- Shader-related features are currently being revised to address issues causing incorrect rendering.

## Example
To help you understand how this program works, we provide an example **Chain** demonstration below.
![Demo GIF](asset/Chain_load.gif)

### How to run
1. Click the **Load Node Graph** button in the application.  
2. Select the `Chain.json` file located in the `example_node` folder.  
3. The example  will be loaded and ready to use.

## Features & Controls
### Assigned Keys
Most interactions are performed using **mouse clicks** and **right-clicks**.
Currently, the only keyboard keys in use are **Shift**, **Delete**, and **P**.
When you want to move or resize the window, hold P.

### Controls

#### Scene Navigation
- Move the scene using **WASD** keys and the **mouse scroll wheel**.  
- **Right-click and drag** to rotate the camera view.

#### Nodes and Links
![Demo](asset/node_feature.gif)
- **Right-click** on the node editor to open the node generator popup.  
  Right-click again to close it.  
- Node types: **func, animation, gen_object, object, shader, setting**  
- `gen_object` creates objects that are defined purely in code. Examples include **Circle** and **Sphere**.
- `object` handles objects that are imported from external files.
- Select a node and press **Delete** to remove it.  
- Drag a node's **output** to another node's **input** to create connections.  
- Node properties can be modified in the **Node Property panel**.  
- The panel includes a **Draw** option for each node.  (Note: If subsequent nodes are connected, a node may not draw due to value overwriting. I am aware of this issue, but it is not critical, so there are no immediate plans to fix it.)

#### Gizmo Controls
![Demo](asset/gizmo.gif)
- Nodes that have objects, `vec3`, or `mat4` values can display a **Gizmo** when selected and in Draw mode, which can be manipulated with the mouse using **Shift + Click**.
- When the Gizmo is displayed, pressing **T** enables **Translation**, and pressing **R** enables **Rotation**.  
**Scale** manipulation is planned for future development.

### Save & Load
You can save and load the current state of all nodes using the **Save**, **Save As**, and **Load Node Graph** buttons.  
Save files are stored in **JSON** format.

### Planned Development
A keyframe editing feature is currently being implemented using ImGizmo’s ImSequencer.
At this stage, the key_frame_sequence nodes support output for float types only.
